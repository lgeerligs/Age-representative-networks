# Age-representative-networks
Contains the ROIs and associated age-representative networks labels as defined in our Journal of Neuroscience paper 'State and Trait Components of Functional Connectivity: Individual Differences Vary with Mental State'
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26468196  

The ROIs are a subset of the ROI-set defined by Craddock and collegues in 2012 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21769991)

We created an age-representative network definition based on this ROI set, which is defined both in excel format ('age_representative_networks.xlsx') and Matlab format ('age_representative_networks.mat'). The networks are also provided in a nifti file ('age_representative_networks.nii'). 
More information about how the networks were derived and which ROIs are included in this subset can be found in our JN paper.
